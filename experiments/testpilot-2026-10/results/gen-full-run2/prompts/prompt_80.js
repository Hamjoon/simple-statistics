Your task is to write a test for the following function
```
simple-statistics.chunk(x, chunkSize)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function chunk(x, chunkSize) {
    // a list of result chunks, as arrays in an array
    var output = [];

    // `chunkSize` must be zero or higher - otherwise the loop below,
    // in which we call `start += chunkSize`, will loop infinitely.
    // So, we'll detect and throw in that case to indicate
    // invalid input.
    if (chunkSize < 1) {
        throw new Error("chunk size must be a positive number");
    }

    if (Math.floor(chunkSize) !== chunkSize) {
        throw new Error("chunk size must be an integer");
    }

    // `start` is the index at which `.slice` will start selecting
    // new array elements
    for (var start = 0; start < x.length; start += chunkSize) {
        // for each chunk, slice that part of the array and add it
        // to the output. The `.slice` function does not change
        // the original array.
        output.push(x.slice(start, start + chunkSize));
    }
    return output;
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let simple_statistics = require('simple-statistics');
describe('test simple_statistics', function() {
    it('test simple-statistics.chunk', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a single, self-contained unit test.  The test should not rely on any external resources. 
For example, it should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.
Keep the three `require` lines exactly as given and make them the first three lines of your code block; do not put a comment, a file name, or anything else before them. Write exactly one `it` block.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block 
```
<unit test>
```
