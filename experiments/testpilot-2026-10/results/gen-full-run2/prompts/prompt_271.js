Your task is to write a test for the following function
```
simple-statistics.modeFast(x)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function modeFast(x) {
    // This index will reflect the incidence of different values, indexing
    // them like
    // { value: count }
    var index = new Map();

    // A running `mode` and the number of times it has been encountered.
    var mode;
    var modeCount = 0;

    for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
        var newCount = index.get(x[i]);
        if (newCount === undefined) {
            newCount = 1;
        } else {
            newCount++;
        }
        if (newCount > modeCount) {
            mode = x[i];
            modeCount = newCount;
        }
        index.set(x[i], newCount);
    }

    if (modeCount === 0) {
        throw new Error("mode requires at last one data point");
    }

    return mode;
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let simple_statistics = require('simple-statistics');
describe('test simple_statistics', function() {
    it('test simple-statistics.modeFast', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a single, self-contained unit test.  The test should not rely on any external resources. 
For example, it should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.
Keep the three `require` lines exactly as given and make them the first three lines of your code block; do not put a comment, a file name, or anything else before them. Write exactly one `it` block.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block 
```
<unit test>
```
