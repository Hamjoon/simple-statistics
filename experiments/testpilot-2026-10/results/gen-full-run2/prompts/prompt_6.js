Your task is to write a test for the following function
```
simple-statistics.BayesianClassifier.prototype.train(item, category)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function train (item, category) {
    // If the data object doesn't have any values
    // for this category, create a new object for it.
    if (!this.data[category]) {
        this.data[category] = {};
    }

    // Iterate through each key in the item.
    for (var k in item) {
        var v = item[k];
        // Initialize the nested object `data[category][k][item[k]]`
        // with an object of keys that equal 0.
        if (this.data[category][k] === undefined) {
            this.data[category][k] = {};
        }
        if (this.data[category][k][v] === undefined) {
            this.data[category][k][v] = 0;
        }

        // And increment the key for this key/value combination.
        this.data[category][k][v]++;
    }

    // Increment the number of items classified
    this.totalCount++;
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let simple_statistics = require('simple-statistics');
describe('test simple_statistics', function() {
    it('test simple-statistics.BayesianClassifier.prototype.train', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a single, self-contained unit test.  The test should not rely on any external resources. 
For example, it should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.
Keep the three `require` lines exactly as given and make them the first three lines of your code block; do not put a comment, a file name, or anything else before them. Write exactly one `it` block.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block 
```
<unit test>
```
