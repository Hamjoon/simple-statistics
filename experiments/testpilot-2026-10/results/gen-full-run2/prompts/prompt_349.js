Your task is to write a test for the following function
```
simple-statistics.rSquared(x, func)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function rSquared(x, func) {
    if (x.length < 2) {
        return 1;
    }

    // Compute the average y value for the actual
    // data set in order to compute the
    // _total sum of squares_
    var sum = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
        sum += x[i][1];
    }
    var average = sum / x.length;

    // Compute the total sum of squares - the
    // squared difference between each point
    // and the average of all points.
    var sumOfSquares = 0;
    for (var j = 0; j < x.length; j++) {
        sumOfSquares += Math.pow(average - x[j][1], 2);
    }

    // Finally estimate the error: the squared
    // difference between the estimate and the actual data
    // value at each point.
    var err = 0;
    for (var k = 0; k < x.length; k++) {
        err += Math.pow(x[k][1] - func(x[k][0]), 2);
    }

    // As the error grows larger, its ratio to the
    // sum of squares increases and the r squared
    // value grows lower.
    return 1 - err / sumOfSquares;
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let simple_statistics = require('simple-statistics');
describe('test simple_statistics', function() {
    it('test simple-statistics.rSquared', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a single, self-contained unit test.  The test should not rely on any external resources. 
For example, it should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.
Keep the three `require` lines exactly as given and make them the first three lines of your code block; do not put a comment, a file name, or anything else before them. Write exactly one `it` block.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block 
```
<unit test>
