Your task is to write a test for the following function
```
simple-statistics.combinationsReplacement(x, k)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function combinationsReplacement(x, k) {
    var combinationList = [];

    for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
        if (k === 1) {
            // If we're requested to find only one element, we don't need
            // to recurse: just push `x[i]` onto the list of combinations.
            combinationList.push([x[i]]);
        } else {
            // Otherwise, recursively find combinations, given `k - 1`. Note that
            // we request `k - 1`, so if you were looking for k=3 combinations, we're
            // requesting k=2. This -1 gets reversed in the for loop right after this
            // code, since we concatenate `x[i]` onto the selected combinations,
            // bringing `k` back up to your requested level.
            // This recursion may go many levels deep, since it only stops once
            // k=1.
            var subsetCombinations = combinationsReplacement(
                x.slice(i, x.length),
                k - 1
            );

            for (var j = 0; j < subsetCombinations.length; j++) {
                combinationList.push([x[i]].concat(subsetCombinations[j]));
            }
        }
    }

    return combinationList;
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let simple_statistics = require('simple-statistics');
describe('test simple_statistics', function() {
    it('test simple-statistics.combinationsReplacement', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a single, self-contained unit test.  The test should not rely on any external resources. 
For example, it should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.
Keep the three `require` lines exactly as given and make them the first three lines of your code block; do not put a comment, a file name, or anything else before them. Write exactly one `it` block.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block 
```
<unit test>
