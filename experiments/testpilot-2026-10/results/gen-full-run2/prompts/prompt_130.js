Your task is to write a test for the following function
```
simple-statistics.equalIntervalBreaks(x, nClasses)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function equalIntervalBreaks(x, nClasses) {
    if (x.length < 2) {
        return x;
    }

    var theMin = min(x);
    var theMax = max(x);

    // the first break will always be the minimum value
    // in the xset
    var breaks = [theMin];

    // The size of each break is the full range of the x
    // divided by the number of classes requested
    var breakSize = (theMax - theMin) / nClasses;

    // In the case of nClasses = 1, this loop won't run
    // and the returned breaks will be [min, max]
    for (var i = 1; i < nClasses; i++) {
        breaks.push(breaks[0] + breakSize * i);
    }

    // the last break will always be the
    // maximum.
    breaks.push(theMax);

    return breaks;
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let simple_statistics = require('simple-statistics');
describe('test simple_statistics', function() {
    it('test simple-statistics.equalIntervalBreaks', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a single, self-contained unit test.  The test should not rely on any external resources. 
For example, it should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.
Keep the three `require` lines exactly as given and make them the first three lines of your code block; do not put a comment, a file name, or anything else before them. Write exactly one `it` block.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block 
```
<unit test>
```
